## Variance partitioning analysis on contact rates

How much variation in contact rates are we missing?

\- Demonstrate from contact surveys with repeat measures that age & occupation do not capture much of the variation between individuals in average contact rates

See variation_partitioning.R for mostly complete code

NEED: Publication-quality single-panel figure of variance partitioning for different surveys
